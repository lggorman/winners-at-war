      <h1>Survivor Turns 20</h1>
      <p>After twenty years and thirty-nine seasons, 
        Survivor has finally delivered on a long anticipated "all winners" season. 
        The cast includes longtime Surivor favorites like Rob Mariano and Parvati Shallow
        as well as more recent winners who grew up watching Rob and Parvati on TV. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the new season is all about existing relationships and "old school" vs "new school" players, I thought it would be fun
        to plot out all the cast members' histories on the show. 
        Each circle represents a season and green circles represent wins; look for circles aligned vertically to see who's played together.
